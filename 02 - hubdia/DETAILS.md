#Hubdia

Hubdia is a social platform and search engine that's focused on organizing the content made by creatives into meaningful collections.

----

##Core Problem
**Creators**, whether they're emerging artists or any other kind of maker, **are having a challenging time collecting and organizing everything they've made into one place**. This is a symptom of an increasingly fast-paced, and quantitative content driven internet. This affects a creator in a few different ways: 

- A creators content has an increasingly shorter shelf life. 
- A creators content might not see the amount of eyes it deserves because of that shelf life. 
- A creator needs to keep up with the amount of content being created, so they don't drown in all the noise, by creating more content on more platforms.  

This creates an awful spiral, one I'm focused on disrupting. 

##Core Solution
Currently, the most bullet proof solutions for creators are to: 

 - Use more social platforms which have less noise
 - Create more content on the social platforms a creator is currently using to stand out, and
 - Have one place, the identity layer, where everything they've done is collected. Commonly, this is the creators' personal website. 


**By focusing on the identity layer solution, Hubdia solves the problems that arise from creators making so much content.** Hubdia **connects** your social platforms, **organizes** the content, and sets it up to help you **contextualize** everything -- what have you done that you love? A creator answering that question makes that content have a longer life. 

###How will an *identity layer* solve the problem a creator has of standing out?
This is *the* important question to ask. **Identity** aligns you with what you love and are inspired by, what resonates with you most. We can show other like-minded creators your stuff, and its more likely to resonate better. 

###Monetization
For the core problem, the monetization strategy isn't ironed out. If I make the platform engaging enough and Damned Good, the monetization strat **will** work itself out, I'm completely confident in this.

##Non-core Problems

###Subproblem 1: Idea propogation

There are a subset of creators who are focused on pushing an idea into a culture or subculture. They utilize multiple mediums to deliver their idea and help it spread where they want it to be. They need to create a ton of content using mediums to really stand out and help their idea spread. 

####Examples/Use Cases/Ideal Stories
**Examples** of these kinds of creators are: 
 - *Neil DeGrasse Tyson* (Speaker, Writer, Podcaster, many more) spreading a love of science. 
 - *Simon Sinek* (Business Leader, Speaker, Writer) speading great leadership. 
 - *Elon Musk* (Business Leader, Engineer, Writer) spreading great product. 
 - *Radiohead + Stanley Donwood + Nigel Godrich* (Musicians, Painters, Graphic Designers, Bloggers, many more) spreading love of a more organic art focus in a digital age. 

**Identities** include, but are not limited to: 
 - Speakers
 - Writers
 - Bloggers
 - Vloggers

I call this customer segment "Idea Entrepreneurs", coined by John Butman in his book, [**Breaking Out: How to Build Influence in a World of Competing Ideas**](http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Out-Build-Influence-Competing/dp/1422172805). 

####How will Hubdia help ideas propogate? 
As an Idea Entrepreneur myself, I think the best way for this is to **first, identify those who have a core idea to push**, then **second, deliver the content they make to people who will love it**. This means you can hyper focus what you make, experiment with different ways to make the idea accessible, and then some. 

####Monetization
I'm not sure how exactly to monetize this right. I think monetization of this non-core problem will iron itself out, so I want to focus on solving the problem first.

###Subproblem 2: Experimentation

Often times, a creator wants to try a new medium. For example, I've always wanted to try Speaking and Podcasting. I haven't executed on this because I don't know the best tools to use, the tools can be expensive, or I don't know any people who would like to collaborate/stumble around with me while I learn. 

Once we collect data on what a person identifies with, we can also collect data on what tools that person uses that helps them make stuff. We can use that data to possibly serve adverts that help a creator try a new medium, or help them find someone close to collaborate with. 

####Examples/Use Cases/Ideal Stories
> **Some User** wants to explore Podcasting as a new medium. On Hubdia, the tools podcasters tend to use are **Some Microphone**, **Some Mixer**, **Some Audio Software**, and **Some Podcasting Service**. Hubdia has a partnership with **Some Seller** where you can buy **Some Microphone** and **Some Mixer** for $100. Alternatives to **Some Audio Software** are **A**, **B**, or **C**. Want someone to collaborate with? **Some User Who Podcasts** is near you, get in touch with them! 

From a design perspective, I don't know what this looks like, but I'm confident this can be accomplished in a super helpful and organic way. 

####Monetization
This is a really good way to monetize, but it's still a phenomenal amount of bottom-line investment before I get this return.

###Subproblem 3: Social Discovery.

####Monetization
 I think this is where the bottom-line will shine.

###Subproblem 4: Building new, and improving old mediums. 

I'm absolutely fascinated with how mediums are shaped to contain ideas that spread in a culture. With Hubdia, we can build new ways to consume content from all the different social platforms. These are essentially satellite apps, among other things. We use The Media Equation to craft new mediums. 


New mediums ironed out, with links to their details:

####Examples/Use Cases/Ideal Stories
This section will be in each of the new mediums descriptions. 

####Monetization
This is a place where top-line return will shine.

###Subproblem 4: Discovery through Diversity. 

This would be functionality that basically listens to what you're talking about on your most used platform to help you discover creators who make stuff about what you're talking about.

####Examples/Use Cases/Ideal Stories
> Mentioning **#yesallwomen** on Twitter will give you a new **#yesallwomen** feed, where you can connect with Poets, Musicians, Vloggers, etc., who also mentioned **#yesallwomen** on the platform they use most. This is a great way to connect and empower all kinds of creators. 


####Monetization
Fuck no
